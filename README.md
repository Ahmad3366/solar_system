## Introduction ðŸš€âœ¨

The Solar System 3D Visualization project is an interactive web-based application that allows users to explore the Solar System in a three-dimensional environment. The project is developed using the Three.js library, which provides powerful tools for creating 3D content on the web. Users can witness the rotation of planets around the Sun and their self-rotation, as well as enjoy the beauty of space in this immersive experience.

## Features ðŸŒŸ

1.Interactive Scene: Use your mouse or touch screen to navigate and explore the solar system from different angles.

2.Celestial Objects: Includes the sun, eight planets (including Pluto)

3.Simple Materials and Textures: Utilizes basic materials and textures to provide a clear visualization.

4. control the speed, visibility of orbits, and the light system
